### About Me
```markdown

In my freshman year, I took classes to learn python and c++ programming languages. I also learnt languages used in web development (HTML, CSS JS) on Udemy.

I have done a few projets such as creating an interactive fiction game and a dice simulation game both using python programming language.

I am currently a member of my school's Google Developers Student Club serving as the Technology Committee Website Laison.

I am a very sporty person and I enjoy playing sports such as soccer and sport based video games such as fifa and nba 2k. I also enjoy reading and programming. 

My ambition is to alleviate hunger in my country through computerized farming which I hope to achieve using artificial intelligence and machine learning.
